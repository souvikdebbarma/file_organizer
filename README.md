This Python script helps you tidy up your files by organizing them into folders based on their extensions. It's super handy for keeping your downloads or any cluttered folder neat.:)

Here's how it works:

First, the script imports the 'os' and 'shutil' modules. 'os' helps with interacting with the operating system, and 'shutil' lets us move files around.

The 'organize_files' function is where the magic happens. You give it a path to a folder, and it goes through each file in that folder. For each file, it figures out the extension (like .jpg, .pdf, etc.). It then checks if there's already a folder for that extension. If there isn't, it makes one. Finally, it moves the file into the correct folder.

When you run the script, it asks you for the path to the folder you want to organize. If the path is valid, it calls the 'organize_files' function and tells you when it's done. If the path isn't valid, it lets you know to try again.
